🚀 Project Completed! 📊

 Super excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my Data Science Toolbox project under INT 375 as part of my B.Tech CSE curriculum at Lovely Professional University.

📈 Project Title: Google Stock Data Analysis & Visualization

 💻 Tools & Tech Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

 📊 Skills Applied:

 ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 ✔️ Data Cleaning & Transformation

 ✔️ Time-Series & Volatility Analysis

 ✔️ Visualizations (Line Charts, Bar Plots, Scatter, Donut Charts)

 ✔️ Quarterly Trends & Volume Insights

The project gave me real-world exposure to working with stock market data, understanding trends, and drawing actionable insights — a solid step toward mastering data analytics in the financial domain!

A big thanks to Dr. Manpreet Singh Sehgal for the constant guidance and mentorship. 🙏

🔍 Next Steps:
